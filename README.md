## Description
Hello! My name is Sasha, I am 18 years old and I study at KHPI. This is my repository, which I will use to practice my skills in the subject of Artificial Intelligence and also it was created for completing my Git & GitHub laboratory.
## My favorite university subjects
1. Artificial Intelligence     
2. Algorithmization and programming  
3. Analytical geometry/Mat.Analyse  


## Online VS offline studying


| **Online** | **Offline** |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
| no strict control| you absorb information better  |
| no time wasted commuting| friends, happy moments |

## My favorite math formulas

Here are some of my favorite math formulas:

$$

ax^2+bx+c=0;

$$

$$

α+β=-\frac{b}{a}​,αβ=\frac{c}{a}

$$

,-**Viète's formulas for quadratic equations**;

$$

D = b^{2} - 4ac

$$

$$

x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}

$$

,-**Discriminant formula and roots of a quadratic equation**;

$$

\frac{AA'}{BB'} = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}

$$

,-**Thales' theorem**;


## My coding skills
Here is literally the simplest C++ code
``` c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, GitHub!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The  `main()` function is the entry point of the program - it starts execution, prints the message to the console, and then ends successfully.
You can prove it through the [code link](https://cpp.sh/?source=%23include+%3Ciostream%3E%0D%0Ausing+namespace+std%3B%0D%0A%0D%0Aint+main()+%7B%0D%0A++++cout+%3C%3C+%22Hello%2C+GitHub!%22+%3C%3C+endl%3B%0D%0A++++return+0%3B%0D%0A%7D).

## The image I like
I like this picture because it reflects my dream of visiting New York at night, experiencing the American vibe, and utilizing my knowledge of English to *achieve my goals*.
